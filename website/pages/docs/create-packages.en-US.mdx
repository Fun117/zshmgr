# Creating and Publishing Your Own Package

## Creating a Demo Package

Here’s how to create a demo package that can be installed with `zshmgr`.

### Directory Structure

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="package_name" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="bin" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="script_name.sh" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="README.md" />
    <FileTree.File name="install.sh" />
    <FileTree.File name="uninstall.sh" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Main Script
```bash filename="bin/script_name.sh"
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello from package_name!"
```

### Installation Script
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Make sure to create an `install.sh` file in the root directory. This file will be executed when the package is installed.
</Callout>

```bash filename="install.sh"
#!/bin/bash

# Detect OS
OS=$(uname -s)

# Move to the script's directory
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

# Installation directory
case $OS in
Linux* | Darwin*)
  INSTALL_DIR="/usr/local/bin"
  ;;
MINGW* | MSYS* | CYGWIN*)
  INSTALL_DIR="/usr/bin"
  ;;
*)
  echo "Unsupported OS: $OS"
  exit 1
  ;;
esac

# Copy the executable file
echo "Installing script_name.sh to $INSTALL_DIR..."
sudo cp bin/script_name.sh $INSTALL_DIR/script_name
sudo chmod +x $INSTALL_DIR/script_name
echo "package_name has been installed. You can now use the 'script_name' command."
```

### Uninstallation Script

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Make sure to create an `uninstall.sh` file in the root directory. This file will be executed when the package is uninstalled.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  Do not use `sudo rm *` as it can delete important user data.
</Callout>

```bash filename="uninstall.sh"
#!/bin/bash

# Detect OS
OS=$(uname -s)

# Move to the script's directory
cd "$(dirname "$0")"

# Installation directory
case $OS in
Linux* | Darwin*)
  INSTALL_DIR="/usr/local/bin"
  ;;
MINGW* | MSYS* | CYGWIN*)
  INSTALL_DIR="/usr/bin"
  ;;
*)
  echo "Unsupported OS: $OS"
  exit 1
  ;;
esac

# Remove the executable file
echo "Uninstalling script_name.sh from $INSTALL_DIR..."
sudo rm $INSTALL_DIR/script_name
echo "package_name has been uninstalled."
```

### Creating the Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub, for example, `package_name`.
2. Create the above file structure and push it to the repository.

### Installing and Running the Demo Package

Use `zshmgr` to install the demo package and verify that the `script_name` command works after installation.

```bash
zshmgr install user/package_name
script_name
```

This ensures that the demo package is correctly installed and can be executed directly from the terminal.
